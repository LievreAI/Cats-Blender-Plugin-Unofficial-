#### Warning, Cats has changed UI wise, please [click here](https://github.com/Yusarina/Cats-Blender-Plugin-Unofficial-/wiki/Features) to see the new UI features.
#### If your plugin is trying to update to a blender 4.0 version or is stuck in a update loop please ensure you using the latest version of the plugin for you blender version from the releases tab [here](https://github.com/Yusarina/Cats-Blender-Plugin-Unofficial-/releases).

You can find both 3.6 and 4.0 blender releases [here](https://github.com/Yusarina/Cats-Blender-Plugin-Unofficial-/releases), ensure you are using the one for your blender version!  

- You can find the development version for Blender 3.6 [here](https://github.com/Yusarina/Cats-Blender-Plugin-Unofficial-/tree/blender-36-dev).
- You can find the development version for Blender 4.0 [here](https://github.com/Yusarina/Cats-Blender-Plugin-Unofficial-/tree/blender-40-dev).
- You can find the development version for Blender 4.1 [here](https://github.com/Yusarina/Cats-Blender-Plugin-Unofficial-/tree/blender-41-dev).

### Warning for Blender 4.0 and 4.1 users:
Though we have updated cats to blender 4.0 and 4.1, please note there are still some issues with MMD Tools which may break some plugin functionality, this is not a cats issue so please redirect those issues to MMD Tools. Blender 4.0 and 4.1 is not our priority and will be behind the blender 3.6 version. We HIGHLY recommend using blender 3.6 for the time being unless you REALLY need the new features in 4.0 and 4.1, which if your just making VRChat models or doing MMD stuff you most likely don't.

Blender 4.1 is also buggy and does have issues as well, we won't be recommending use of blender 4.x unto the first LTS comes out later this year.

With Cats it takes only a few minutes to upload your model into VRChat.
All the hours long processes of fixing your models are compressed into a few functions!

## Features

Please [Click Here](https://github.com/Yusarina/Cats-Blender-Plugin-Unofficial-/wiki/Features) to view the features of cats.


## Requirements

- Blender 3.6 or above (run as administrator is recommended) (Please note some features may not work in version below 3.6).
   - Blender 3.6 is Recommended as this is the latest LTS.
   - Though I have updated CATS to Blender 4.0, I do not currently recommend using 4.0 as there multiple issues with MDD Tools and Blender 4.0 which cats uses.
- Anything older then 3.6 is not supported and no longer works.
- If you have custom Python installed which Blender might use, you need to have Numpy installed
- Note to Windows Store users: Though Cats seems to work on Windows Store these days no support will be given if there are any issues as the Unofficial cats does not support Windows store due to issues Windows Store versions of Blender have given in the past. 

#### Additional Plugins Requirements.
Some features of Cat's need additional plugins to work, you can find them here:

- Immersive Scaler: https://github.com/triazo/immersive_scaler
